# PV_Data_Collection
 
2020-12-WIC is a data-set which contains the output characteristics of a 3-series PV string over 3 days (from 2021/12/21 to 2021/12/23). Data collections were conducted on a hydrophilic platform at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (latitude 31.269° N and longitude 120.740° E), where the PV string is affected by the shadows of near-by buildings, landscape facilities, and plants. The specifications of the PV module used in this data-set is listed as follows.
 
Parameter| Value 
 ---- | ----- 
Maximum Power Pmpp | 50.00W 
Open Circuit Voltage Voc  | 22.02V  
Short Circuit Current Isc | 3.18A 
Voltage at Pmpp | 17.82V  
Current at Pmpp | 2.80A 
Cells per Module | 36  

I used PROVA-1011 PV System Analyzer to record the IV curve for PV system.
